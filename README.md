# Download-box

*Download-box* is a Chrome extension that gets rid of the ugly shelf that Chrome
somehow still uses. It gives you a modern drop-down to view your current and
past downloads, with things like shortcuts to show their folder locations.

This extension is intended to be a replacement to *Downloads: Your Downloads
Box*, which was removed from the Chrome store some time ago. It comes with a few
updates, like pagination and support for multiple languages.

It is still a work-in-progress.
